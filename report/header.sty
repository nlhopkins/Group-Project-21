\lettrine[lines=2,slope=0pt,nindent=0pt, loversize=0.2]{S}{hear} stress alters endothelial responses via developmental pathways. This is thought to play a role in atherosclerosis formation in regions of low shear stress. Wnt is a developmental pathway expressed in embryogenesis, which is also upregulated in atherosclerosis. Previous studies also suggest that Wnt upregulates Angiopoietin 1, which is angiogenic, and downregulates THBS1, which is antiangiogenic. In this study, we investigated whether these genes are regulated by shear stress and if they are mediated by Wnt in atherosclerosis. A previously published orbital shaker model was adapted to analyse the expression of ANGPT2 and THBS1 in low shear stress, which was compared to their expression in high shear stress. We also assessed whether these genes are mediated by canonical Wnt signalling using an inhibitor. Our results suggested that expression of ANGPT2 and THBS1 were both downregulated in low shear stress, and downregulated by Wnt. This revealed potential caveats in our study, which are then discussed, along with resolutions and future suggestions to investigate our genes of interest.\\
